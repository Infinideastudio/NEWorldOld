### Supported platforms
Windows ONLY because of the horrible things happened in Linux.
### Supported compilers
Visual C++ ONLY because of a lot of compiler-specific code and a lot of work to compile required components in other compilers.
## Histroy
This project was launched by qiaozhanrong when he was in Grade Four and it soon became famous in Baidu Tieba.

It is developed by qiaozhanrong,abc612008 and SuperSodaSea.

Its first web address is: http://tieba.baidu.com/p/2822071396/

Its ordinary name was MineMinecraft,but its name changed to NEWorld because of the problems in law.

Its programming language was FreeBASIC and this lasts for a long time until abc612008 translates it into C++ in 2015.7.

When it is translated,some problems happened because there are some features that FreeBASIC supports but VC++ doesn't.So abc612008 used a lot of Windows API to solve this problem,and it became platform-specific.

Then,because qiaozhanrong are forced to take part in NOIP,which is a famous and important programming contest in China,he finally decided to give up the development of this game.But because he loved this game so much,he continued the development after.

The last FreeBASIC version of NEWorld was released on 2015.9.17.Then it was deprecated.

Qiaozhanrong designed the C++ version of NEWorld in September and October and it became the offical version of NEWorld.

After the change of programming language,qiaozhanrong fixed several bugs of NEWorld and optimized it.As he said,he can even fix one bug per day!


I forked this repository on Nov 28, 2015.After forking it,I decided to add several features and make it portable.Unluckily,I didn't notice the coming bugfixes on the main branch,so I fixed several bugs manually.

I removed a lot of platform-specific code and compiler-specific code to make it portable.But there are still some things I cannot control that make this impossible.In this period,I had to use wxWidgets because it is very hard to write them manually on many platforms.

I deprecated the GUI system of NEWorld and used wxWidgets instead.This could be a very sad thing.
