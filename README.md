# NEWorld
NEWorld is a open-source game, its game rule just like Minecraft.
--------------------------------------------------
There is a Visual Studio solution & project here. And you can also compile it by any C++ compiler which support the C++11 standards.

Paths and compiler options can be found in the VS project. (Normally, you can compile it without editing it.)
