# NEWorld
NEWorld is an open-source game, its game rule is just like Minecraft.
--------------------------------------------------
There is a Visual Studio solution & project here. And you can also compile it with any C++ compiler which support the C++11 standards.

Paths and compiler options can be found in the VS project. (Normally, you can compile it without editing.)

Welcome to develop with us!
