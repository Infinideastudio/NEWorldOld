# NEWorld

NEWorld is an open-source game with similar game rules to Minecraft.  

--------------------------------------------------  

There is a Visual Studio 2022 solution. If you have installed VS2022 on your computer, you can use the solution.

You can also compile it with any C++ compiler that supports the ISO C++20 standards. But you need to set some directories.
  
- Library headers are in the directory 'include'.
- Libraries should go to 'libraries' (you must download them manually for now, this includes the latest versions of GLFW3, GLEW and FreeType2).
- Source code is in 'source'.
