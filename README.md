# NEWorld
NEWorld is an open-source game with similar game rules to Minecraft.
--------------------------------------------------
There is a Visual Studio solution & project included. You can also compile it with any C++ compiler that supports the C++11 standards.

Paths and compiler options can be found in the VS project. (Normally, you can compile without editing it.)
