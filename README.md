# NEWorld
NEWorld is an open-source game with similar game rules to Minecraft.  
--------------------------------------------------  
There is a Visual Studio 2015 solution. If you have installed VS2015 on your computer, you can use the solution.

You can also compile it with any C++ compiler that supports the ISO C++11 standards. But you need to set some directories.  
  
For client:  
- Library headers are in the directory 'include'.

- Source code is in 'source'. (Maybe there are some encoding problems...)  
  
For server:
