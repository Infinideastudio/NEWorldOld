//! Application bring-up — winit `ApplicationHandler` plus the per-frame
//! render entry point.
//!
//! Owns the window, the wgpu context (`Gfx`), the shared atlases and frame
//! uniform buffer, the HUD text renderer, the egui renderer, the screen
//! stack, and (when a world is loaded) the [`Game`] instance that holds the
//! live world + camera + chunk meshes.
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//! * App boots into the title screen with `game = None`. The world is not
//!   touched until the user picks one.
//! * The title / world-select / pause screens push `WorldAction`s into a
//!   shared mailbox; [`App::process_world_actions`] drains it at the start
//!   of each frame and reacts (load a world, save + drop the current world,
//!   delete a world's directory).
//! * In-game flow: `screen_stack` is empty, `game.is_some()`, the
//!   `GameScreen` runs the HUD; pause / chat overlays sit on the stack.
//! * Out-of-game flow: `game = None`, `screen_stack` has at least the title
//!   on the bottom.
