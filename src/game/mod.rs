//! Game state — the orchestrator that owns the world, the camera, and the
//! GPU mesh cache, and drives the per-frame simulation.
//!
//! Implements `[F2]`–`[F6]` from `docs/rust_migration.md` §5:
//!
//! * `[F2]` — block selection raycast, breaking, and placing.
//! * `[F3]` — chat dispatch via [`crate::commands::CommandRegistry`].
//! * `[F5]` — async chunk loading: [`World::tick_chunk_loading_async`] +
//!   [`World::poll_load_results`] are pumped per frame; chunks stream into
//!   the slab over the first few frames.
//! * `[F6]` — async chunk meshing: dirty coords ship to a worker via
//!   [`MeshPipeline`] and the resulting `MeshOutput`s are uploaded to GPU as
//!   they arrive (see [`Self::pump_meshing`]).
//!
//! Player / camera split:
//! * The [`crate::worlds::Player`] owns the simulation state — position,
//!   velocity, orientation, gravity, hitbox collision, jump bookkeeping. Its
//!   `update(world)` runs in [`Self::tick_sim`] at 30 Hz.
//! * The [`Camera`] is a passive view: every frame, [`Self::tick_render`]
//!   mirrors `player.orientation()` into `camera.yaw/pitch`, and
//!   [`Self::write_frame_uniforms`] reads the interpolated eye position
//!   (`player.look_coord() - velocity * (1 - interp)`) into `camera.position`.
//!
//! Owns:
//!
//! * a [`World`] whose chunk window is sized by the configured render distance;
//! * a coord-keyed map of [`ChunkMesh`]es so async-mesh delivery can find
//!   the right slot in O(1);
//! * a [`Camera`] whose state is pushed in from the player every frame;
//! * the [`ChunkPipeline`] / [`ParticlePipeline`] / [`DepthTarget`] from `[D]`;
//! * a [`ParticleSystem`] (block-break particles spawn into it);
//! * a [`CommandRegistry`] populated by [`register_base_commands`];
//! * the current selection [`Hit`] and the current view-projection matrix
//!   (used by the HUD to draw a selection outline overlay).
